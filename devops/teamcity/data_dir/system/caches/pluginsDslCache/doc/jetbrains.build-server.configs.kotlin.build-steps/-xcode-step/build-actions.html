<p>Xcode build action(s). The default actions are clean and build.
A space-separated list of the following actions is supported: clean, build, test, archive, installsrc, install;
the order of actions will be preserved during execution.
It is not recommended changing this field unless you are sure you want to change the number or order of actions.
If your project is built under Xcode 5+, setting the runTests option
automatically adds the test build action to the list (unless the option is already explicitly specified in the current field).</p>
